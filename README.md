# Parkinson-Detection

use resnet50 or densenet121 to train test and save the model
make sure to give more than 80% accuracy so that it can predict perfectly
when i upload other image such as tree car and other it should give image not recognised [non spiral or non wave]
when a person draw in live of spiral or wave image and if he upload that image without training that image it should give healthy or Parkinson detected based on his drawings
make sure to add confidence threshold to detect other images as not recognised other than spiral and wave
